  <h2>Installation Guide</h2>
  <p>
    The installation of University pages is straightforward, the database is automatically built and some important data is included on the first api call.
    If your database configuration is not the default it can be changed at /inc/DB/db.php.
  </p>
  <h2>oAuth</h2>
  <p>
    The only major issue with installation is a problem with the oAuth login system.
    This system uses google authentication to authorise users, as such it requires 3rd party configuration to function correctly.
    UniPages by default will function with oAuth ONLY if it is hosted at <strong>localhost:8080</strong> this is due to google denying any authorisation that redirects to a public IP address and requiring you to pre authorise redirect URl's.
    <br> <br>
    I have included alternative methods of login for testing purposes but to use oAuth you must host at <strong>localhost:8080</strong>
